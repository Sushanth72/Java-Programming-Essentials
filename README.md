# Java-Programming-Essentials
The repository contains a collection of Java programs focusing on object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. These programs were developed as part of a comprehensive study of Java's capabilities in various computer science domains. Below is an overview of the key programs included:
1. Object-Oriented Design
  Student Class: Implementation of a Student class with attributes such as USN, Name, Branch, and Phone. Demonstrates object creation and manipulation.
  Stack Implementation: A custom implementation of the Stack data structure using arrays, with methods for Push, Pop, and Display operations.
2. Inheritance and Polymorphism
  Staff Hierarchy: A superclass Staff with subclasses Teaching, Technical, and Contract, each extending the base class to represent different staff types.
  Customer Class with StringTokenizer: A class to store customer data and format the date of birth using StringTokenizer.
3. Exception Handling and Multithreading
  Exception Handling: Program to handle division by zero exceptions gracefully.
  Multithreading: A multi-threaded application with three threads to generate, square, and cube random integers.
4 & 5. Sorting Algorithms and Time Complexity Analysis
  Quick Sort: Implementation of Quick Sort with time complexity analysis for large datasets.
  Merge Sort: Implementation of Merge Sort with time complexity analysis, comparing best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
6. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
  Dynamic Programming and Greedy Method: Two approaches to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem, demonstrating different problem-solving strategies.
7. Dijkstra's Algorithm
  Shortest Path Calculation: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source vertex in a weighted graph.
8 & 9. Minimum Cost Spanning Tree
  Kruskal's Algorithm: Implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm using Union-Find to determine the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree.
  Prim's Algorithm: Implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree in an undirected graph.
10. Advanced Algorithms
  All-Pairs Shortest Paths: Implementation of Floyd’s algorithm.
  Travelling Salesperson Problem: Dynamic programming solution for the TSP.
11. Subset Sum Problem
  Backtracking Solution: Design and implementation of a solution to find a subset of numbers that sum to a given value.
12. Hamiltonian Cycles
  Backtracking Implementation: Program to find all Hamiltonian cycles in a connected undirected graph.
